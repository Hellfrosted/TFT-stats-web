## 🕹️ How to Use

1. **Capture Screenshots**: During your games, take screenshots at stages **4-3, 4-5, or 5-1**. I use MetaTFT desktop app automated screenshot for this.
2. **Upload**: Drag and drop your screenshot folder into the dashboard.
3. **Review**:
   - Confirm your **final placement** (1st-8th) for each detected game.
   - If an augment icon is new, the tool will ask you to name it. This saves it to your local database!
4. **Analyze**: View your personal stats in the sortable table.

## 📝 Updating for New Sets

The tool is designed to be future-proof. When a new set releases, simply continue using the tool. As you "Name" unknown augments in the review screen, your personal database will grow with the new icons!
